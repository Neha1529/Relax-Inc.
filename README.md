# Findings
The dataset contained basic information & engagement data of 8823 users. There are 1656 adopted users.I found that length of user history is the most important feature. User history is defined as number of days from account creation to latest session.If a user is still using the product for more than 100 days then he is likely to be an adopted user. User using more than 200 days is certainly an adopted user.New users are less likely to be adopted users.

The next important feature is account creation source.Users invited by other users & those signed up for personal projects are liekly to become adopted users.
A random forest model can predict user adoption rate with >95% accuracy.

Hence,it is recommended that by encouraging existing users to log in,adoption rate can be increased.Encouraging users to invite others, and offering incentives for people to work on their personal projects using the product might turn out effective. 

Detailed user's response,like to marketing moves is needed to analyze what all factors turn users into adopted users.More information about the organizations would be needed in finding out what type of organization should Relax Inc. target to increase adoption rate.
